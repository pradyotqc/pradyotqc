Hi, I’m Pradyot! 👋
⚛️ Bridging the Quantum Realm with Real-World Impact
👀 I'm deeply immersed in the fascinating world of Quantum Computing, exploring cutting-edge Quantum Algorithms, and pioneering Optimization techniques for both fundamental physics challenges and complex real-world problems.

🌱 My journey currently involves deepening my expertise in quantum technologies and their diverse applications in complex systems. I'm actively hands-on with both digital gate-based quantum hardware like IBM QPUs and analog quantum computing platforms such as D-Wave's quantum annealers for optimization problems, particularly in physics.

🚀 I'm also expanding my horizons into GPU computing and NVIDIA CUDA to accelerate high-performance quantum computing, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

✨ My algorithmic toolkit includes VQE, QPE, HHL, QAE, QSCI, VQLS, and VarQA. I'm also actively integrating these quantum algorithms into cutting-edge Quantum Machine Learning techniques.

💞️ Let's Innovate Together!
I'm eagerly looking to collaborate on industry and research-related projects that push the boundaries of quantum science and optimization. If you're working on challenges in quantum hardware, algorithm development, quantum machine learning, or accelerating quantum computing with GPUs, I'd love to connect!
